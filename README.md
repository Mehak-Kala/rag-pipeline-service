A scalable, containerized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows users to upload up to 20 PDF documents (each up to 1000 pages) and query them using a conversational interface powered by Google Gemini. Built with Flask, FAISS, HuggingFace embeddings, and Docker.

The application is containerized using Docker. You can deploy it on any platform that supports Docker, such as AWS, GCP, or Azure.
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
